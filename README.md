# leetcode-discord-RPC


# - u run the bat file and it puts you into debugger mode and you can sign into profile after also check using the link http://localhost:9222/json

# this a fun project im working on to display activity on leetcode on discord

# also google needs to be run in debugger mode HUGE THING so it keeps track even when not tabbed in !

current issue is bc this doesnt use an extension, I cant display the actual live rank and I have another version with lanague if I want to fix I might drop an extension that works aswell 

# heres some pictures of it:
