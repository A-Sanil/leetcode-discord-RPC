# leetcode-discord-RPC


# also google needs to be run in debugger mode HUGE THING so it keeps track even when not tabbed in !

# u run the bat file and it puts you into debugger mode and you can sign into profile after also check using the link http://localhost:9222/json

 this a fun project im working on to display activity on leetcode on discord


current issue is bc this doesnt use an extension, I cant display the actual live actualt level of the problem ie : hard, easy, medium and I have another version with lanague if I want to fix I might drop an extension that works aswell 

if anyone could help pls drop a pull adding one cause I think discord RPC is cool
